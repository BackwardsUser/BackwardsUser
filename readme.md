# Hello, I'm Alexander Harding.
### I'm a ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canadian College Student studying Software Development!

I love coding, My favourite thing to code are Discord Bots, they're super simple to get running and its super cool to visually see the bot coming online.

My favourite project I am working on is my likely my Chat Room, sure its basic and is likely never going to take off, seeing as there are so many Chat applications on the market (Teams, Discord, Slack..) but its still cool to try and get working.

I have two major projects at the moment:
1. My Chat Room - This is a project I've been working for quite some time, I have no intention of becoming the next Discord, however it's been a pretty good learning experience.
2. My Discord Music Bot - I am creating a *free* and public discord bot that anyone can run locally, due to discord cracking down on music bots a lot harder now, I was hoping to solve that.

I do have a third project, however I am sort of wanning interest in it at the moment. My Bot Manager, or Dot; I created Dot because I realized that if you were a Discord Server owner, you were forced to trust in Bot Developers, public bots, YouTube tutorials or actual coding abilities. This application was made so you could make a bot with no thought on how it worked. However I've put a hold on the bot realizing that the concept would be super difficult to bring to life as I am unsure how to implement this idea. If you have any ideas, feel free to make an issue on its repository, [Here](https://github.com/BackwardsUser/Dot-Bot-Manager/issues).
